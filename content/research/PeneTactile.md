Tactile Phantom Sensations that Feel Like Penetrating Body (CHI 2020)
<!--more-->

![Teasor][1]

>In tactie interaction, a phantom sensation refers to an illusion felt on the skin between two distant points at which vibrations are applied. It can improve the spatial perceptual resolution of tactile stimulation with a few tactors. A phantom sensation can be stationary or moving, but most of the phantom sensations reported in the literature act on the skin. 

>In this paper, we address tactile phantom sensations that penetrate part of the body: two vibration actuators on the dorsal and palmar sides of the hand can elicit the illusion of vibration passing through the hand. We also demonstrate similar tactile illusions for the torso. For optimal design, we conducted user studies while varying vibration frequency, envelope function, stimulus duration, and penetrating direction. Based on the results, we present design guidelines on penetrating phantom sensations for its use in immersive virtual reality applications.
